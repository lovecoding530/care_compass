Pain can affect every aspect of your life and can often be managed with your health care team. Below are some facts about pain:</p><ul><li>Not everyone with a life-limiting illness will experience pain  </li><li>Everyone experiences pain differently, so the way you experience pain will be unique to you</li><li>Most pain can be relieved to a level that allows you to continue to live your life</li><li>Pain can be due to different reasons dependent on the cause and therefore it may take more than one type of painkiller (known as an analgesic) to control it</li><li>Pain is not always constant, it can change over the day and with different activities and can fluctuate with your moods, emotions and family life</li></ul><p><b>How can pain be managed?</b></p><p>Pain management starts with speaking with your health care professional, such as your GP, your specialist or palliative care team. It is essential that you are honest about your pain so it can be assessed and planned for, for you as an individual. It is also important to remember that your pharmacist is a great resource for information about your pain and other medications. Keeping a diary of when your pain occurs and what makes it worse or better will help with this conversation. </p><p>With your practitioner, you will have an assessment of your illness and pain and they will develop a pain management plan. This will probably have a mix of non-medicine and medicine based ways to help with your pain. </p><p><b>What are opioid medicines?</b></p><p>Opioid medicines are pain relievers. They include medicines such as codeine, morphine and oxycodone. Knowing the facts and helping to unravel a few myths, will help you, your family and carers understand opioid medicines. This will help you manage your pain effectively so you can get on with living as well as possible with a life-limiting illness. </p><p>Opioids are medicines that are prescribed for strong or severe pain that is no longer responding to medications of lesser strength. They come in different forms such as tablets, patches or a liquid and your prescriber (e.g. your GP) will discuss which one is best for you and your individual pain treatment. They also help to manage shortness of breath, severe diarrhea or cough.</p><p>It is normal when you start taking opioids to use different amounts (known as intermittent dosing) to find the right dose that can cover your pain over a 24 hour period. You may continue to use intermittent dosing so you can still do activities and be more in control of your pain. If you are needing more than 3 intermittent doses every day, you should contact your practitioner to revise your pain management plan. </p><p>Remember always take your medication as prescribed and store as instructed by your pharmacist, and if unsure, ask your practitioner.</p><p>If you have any questions please speak with your health care team.

Pain often accompanies cancer and other progressive diseases and it can affect all aspects of your life.</p><p><b>Why are we afraid of pain?</b></p><p>Many people living with a life-limiting illness are afraid of pain because they worry it canâ€™t be controlled without unwanted side effects. It is important to speak up about your pain and ask questions so that you can be given accurate information.</p><p><b>Fearing pain doesnâ€™t make you appear weak</b></p><p>People interpret their pain according to their own life experiences, values and beliefs. Sharing your fears about pain with your health care team may reduce your anxiety and provide you with a plan in which to address current or future pain. You may also wish to discuss your fears with a religious leader or a spiritual carer. Everyoneâ€™s experience of pain, if present, in a disease is different and often unspoken fears can be worse than the reality.</p><p><b>Can pain always be controlled?</b></p><p>Most pain can be relieved or controlled. Bringing pain under control means assessing all aspects of pain and monitoring it. These are core skills of palliative doctors and nurses.</p><p><b>How is pain controlled?</b></p><p>Pain control starts with open communication about what you are experiencing with your health care team. Pain control plans are tailored to meet your particular needs and will be followed up and adjusted as your needs change. A plan may involve a combination of medication and non-medication options. You should always discuss with your health care team if you want less or more pain relief.</p><p><b>When must I take medication?</b></p><p>When pain medication is prescribed for you, you must take it on time. Do not wait to experience pain. The schedule is designed to prevent pain from occurring, not to treat it after it arrives since this type of pain tends to be predictable and the level of pain is often able be reduced with pre-emptive dosing.</p><p><b>What about breakthrough pain?</b></p><p>There may be times you receive pain despite being on regular pain medication. This is called breakthrough pain and can be very distressing for you and your carer. Your practitioner will prescribe additional medication to be taken as needed. Keep a record and talk to your health care team about the amounts you are needing. If extra medication for breakthrough pain has not been prescribed, speak to your General Practitioner or your health care team without delay. Sometimes breakthrough pain means you need an increase in regular medication or a different type of pain medication. The goal of pain management is to prevent pain; it is more difficult to try to control pain once it has occurred.</p><p>If you have any questions please speak with your health care team.

Grief is a normal response to loss and it can affect every part of our lives and it will vary for each person. Grieving can last a long time, and for many, may not come to an end, but it may help to know that your grief will become less raw over time. You will never forget or stop missing the person who has died, but in time, you become better at living with the loss.</p><p><b>What can grief feel like?</b></p><p>While painful, grief is a normal expected process that can include a range of reactions and changes in our feelings, behaviours, beliefs and bodies</p><p><i>Feelings</i> â€“ People may experience intense feelings such as shock, sadness, anger, and anxiety.</p><p><i>Behaviours</i> â€“ People may experience lethargy or overactivity, sleep a lot or resort to alcohol and other potentially harmful behaviours.</p><p><i>Physical reactions</i> â€“ Grief can lead to physical symptoms such as insomnia, tiredness and loss of appetite.</p><p><i>Beliefs</i> â€“ Peopleâ€™s beliefs about life may be challenged.

Palliative Care Australia (PCA) has provided recommended delivery approaches that can be used by aged care staff to frame conversations based on the consumerâ€™s experience in reflecting and discussing. These resources are another tool that staff alongside their professional skills, rapport and knowledge of the consumerâ€™s individual situation.</p><p>End-of-life is a difficult topic to discuss and people may progress slowly over a period of months or years. Nonetheless, it is important to start these conversations early so people living with dementia have the opportunity to reflect and discuss their future care wishes. The Care Compass Study Discussion Starter Series was developed with this in mind, acknowledging the need for multiple conversations over a period of time as determined by the needs and comfort level of the person living with dementia. The below information has been written on the assumption the client has already consented to participate in the Care Compass Study and Discussion Starter Activity 1: About the Study has been discussed with the consumer. Please refer to information provided by the Australian Catholic University regarding the informed consent process.</p><p><b>Working with clients who have never reflected</b></p><p>Working with people who have never reflected on their own end-of-life preferences will have their own stories as to why this is the case. The reasons for not having reflected may include:</p><ul><li>Cultural or religious traditions,</li><li>Fear of dying,</li><li>Belief that they are too young,</li><li>Belief that they are too healthy,</li><li>Reliance on others to raise the conversation,</li><li>History of trauma and abuse,</li><li>Currently experiencing abuse and neglect.</li></ul><p>People who have never reflected will have varied experiences and thoughts on discussing care at the end-of-life which is why an individual approach to each person is crucial to having an effective conversation.</p><p>The Discussion Starter Activity 2: About You may be a good icebreaker for people who have not reflected on their preferences in the past and may not know where to start. The Activity has questions that assist staff to get to know the person. The questions can be utilised in a conversational manner rather than a true question and answer method, which may help the person to relax and fell less overwhelmed.</p><p>At the end of the session, if the person has utilised the app they should be provided with a print out of the information entered. This information may be used by the person for their own self-reflection and/or for discussion with family and carers. This will also assist the person to prepare for follow up conversations.</p><p><b>Working with patients who have reflected</b></p><p>A person who has reflected on their own end-of-life preferences will have a variety of reasons for reflection, as well as differences in the depth of reflection. Some people may have thought about their preferences after reading a book or watching a news story while others may have reflected after the death of a close friend or family member or due to their own health crisis.</p><p>It is important to remember that although a person identifies as having reflected, they may not have discussed their thoughts and preferences with another person. Each person will differ in the level of information they share about their reflections but it should be acknowledged that this first conversation about their preferences is an important milestone.</p><p>If a person is open to discussing their reflections, it would be great to start with the Discussion Starter</p><p>Activity 3 â€“ About Your Health Care. However, if a person is finding it difficult to discuss their reflections, the Discussion Starter Activity 2 â€“ About You may be best place to start.</p><p><b>Working with patients who are prepared to discuss</b></p><p>People who are prepared to discuss their end-of-life preferences have probably reflected previously and may have a good understanding of their preferences. In this case, a soft introduction to the discussion may include a review of their previous reflections and how relevant they are at this point. This exercise will support the person to consider how and if their preferences have changed before building on these further with Discussion Starter Activity 3: About Your Health Care and Discussion Starter Activity 4: About Your Care at the End of Your Life. When discussing Activity 4, be aware that people may be comfortable openly discussing the first questions but may need some additional time to reflect on the later questions.</p><p><b>Working with patients who have discussed</b></p><p>When working with people who have discussed their end-of-life preferences previously, it may be good to start with a general reflection exercise with questions such as:</p><ul><li>When did you last discuss your end-of-life preferences?</li><li>Who did you discuss this with?</li><li>What initiated the discussion?</li></ul><p>This exercise will allow the person to lead the conversation and give the staff an indication of their comfort level on the topic. If the person is comfortable in discussing the topic, it may be worthwhile skipping forward to Discussion Starter Activity 4: About Your Care at the End of Your Life to ensure capture the personâ€™s preferences whilst they are willing and able to have the discussion.</p>","featured_image":null,"tags":["resources"],"faqs":[],"slug":"resources-action"}]}],"get_help":[{"title":"Get Help","slug":"get-help","tagline":"Services that can help when you are in need","services":[]}],"looking_after_yourself":[{"title":"Looking after yourself","body":"<p> Many people who work in the health and aged care sectors have a desire to help others.
