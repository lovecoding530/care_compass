Pain can affect every aspect of your life and can often be managed with your health care team. Below are some facts about pain:</p><ul><li>Not everyone with a life-limiting illness will experience pain</li><li>Everyone experiences pain differently, so the way you experience pain will be unique to you</li><li>Most pain can be relieved to a level that allows you to continue to live your life</li><li>Pain can be due to different reasons dependent on the cause and therefore it may take more than one type of painkiller(known as an analgesic) to control it</li><li>Pain is not always constant, it can change over the day and with different activities and can fluctuate with your moods, emotions and family life</li></ul><p><b>How can pain be managed?</b></p><p>Pain management starts with speaking with your health care professional, such as your GP, your specialist or palliative care team. It is essential that you are honest about your pain so it can be assessed and planned for, for you as an individual. It is also important to remember that your pharmacist is a great resource for information about your pain and other medications. Keeping a diary of when your pain occurs and what makes it worse or better will help with this conversation.</p><p>With your practitioner, you will have an assessment of your illness and pain and they will develop a pain management plan. This will probably have a mix of non-medicine and medicine based ways to help with your pain.</p><p><b>What are opioid medicines?</b></p><p>Opioid medicines are pain relievers. They include medicines such as codeine, morphine and oxycodone. Knowing the facts and helping to unravel a few myths, will help you, your family and carers understand opioid medicines. This will help you manage your pain effectively so you can get on with living as well as possible with a life-limiting illness.</p><p>Opioids are medicines that are prescribed for strong or severe pain that is no longer responding to medications of lesser strength. They come in different forms such as tablets, patches or a liquid and your prescriber (e.g. your GP) will discuss which one is best for you and your individual pain treatment. They also help to manage shortness of breath, severe diarrhea or cough.</p><p>It is normal when you start taking opioids to use different amounts (known as intermittent dosing) to find the right dose that can cover your pain over a 24 hour period. You may continue to use intermittent dosing so you can still do activities and be more in control of your pain. If you are needing more than 3 intermittent doses every day, you should contact your practitioner to revise your pain management plan.</p><p>Remember always take your medication as prescribed and store as instructed by your pharmacist, and if unsure, ask your practitioner.</p><p>If you have any questions please speak with your health care team.

Pain often accompanies cancer and other progressive diseases and it can affect all aspects of your life.</p><p><b>Why are we afraid of pain?</b></p><p>Many people living with a life-limiting illness are afraid of pain because they worry it can’t be controlled without unwanted side effects. It is important to speak up about your pain and ask questions so that you can be given accurate information.</p><p><b>Fearing pain doesn’t make you appear weak</b></p><p>People interpret their pain according to their own life experiences, values and beliefs. Sharing your fears about pain with your health care team may reduce your anxiety and provide you with a plan in which to address current or future pain. You may also wish to discuss your fears with a religious leader or a spiritual carer. Everyone’s experience of pain, if present, in a disease is different and often unspoken fears can be worse than the reality.</p><p><b>Can pain always be controlled?</b></p><p>Most pain can be relieved or controlled. Bringing pain under control means assessing all aspects of pain and monitoring it. These are core skills of palliative doctors and nurses.</p><p><b>How is pain controlled?</b></p><p>Pain control starts with open communication about what you are experiencing with your health care team. Pain control plans are tailored to meet your particular needs and will be followed up and adjusted as your needs change. A plan may involve a combination of medication and non-medication options. You should always discuss with your health care team if you want less or more pain relief.</p><p><b>When must I take medication?</b></p><p>When pain medication is prescribed for you, you must take it on time. Do not wait to experience pain. The schedule is designed to prevent pain from occurring, not to treat it after it arrives since this type of pain tends to be predictable and the level of pain is often able be reduced with pre-emptive dosing.</p><p><b>What about breakthrough pain?</b></p><p>There may be times you receive pain despite being on regular pain medication. This is called breakthrough pain and can be very distressing for you and your carer. Your practitioner will prescribe additional medication to be taken as needed. Keep a record and talk to your health care team about the amounts you are needing. If extra medication for breakthrough pain has not been prescribed, speak to your General Practitioner or your health care team without delay. Sometimes breakthrough pain means you need an increase in regular medication or a different type of pain medication. The goal of pain management is to prevent pain; it is more difficult to try to control pain once it has occurred.</p><p>If you have any questions please speak with your health care team.

Some of those myths are below but for more information please refer to the links at the bottom of the page.</p><p><b>Myth:</b> <i>pain is an inevitable part of dying</i>.</p><p><b>Fact:</b> Not everyone with a life-limiting illness will experience pain. Most pain can be relieved or controlled. Bringing pain under control means assessing all aspects of pain and monitoring it.</p><p><b>Myth:</b> <i>Palliative care is only available in the last few days before you die</i>.</p><p><b>Fact:</b> Palliative care should be available for people when they are diagnosed with a life-limiting illness that is likely to cause their death.

Grief is a normal response to loss and it can affect every part of our lives and it will vary for each person. Grieving can last a long time, and for many, may not come to an end, but it may help to know that your grief will become less raw over time. You will never forget or stop missing the person who has died, but in time, you become better at living with the loss.</p><p><b>What can grief feel like?</b></p><p>While painful, grief is a normal expected process that can include a range of reactions and changes in our feelings, behaviours, beliefs and bodies</p><p><i>Feelings</i> – People may experience intense feelings such as shock, sadness, anger, and anxiety.</p><p><i>Behaviours</i> – People may experience lethargy or overactivity, sleep a lot or resort to alcohol and other potentially harmful behaviours.</p><p><i>Physical reactions</i> – Grief can lead to physical symptoms such as insomnia, tiredness and loss of appetite.</p><p><i>Beliefs</i> – People’s beliefs about life may be challenged. Often grieving people wonder why this has happened to them.</p><p><b>How do we grieve?</b></p><p>Everyone grieves in their own way and it is important to remember that there is no right way or time to grieve.</p><p>Members of the same family will grieve in their own way.

Others may be reluctant to talk and prefer to keep busy.</p><p>It is important to respect each other’s way of grieving.</p><p><b>Helping yourself</b></p><p>Being a carer for someone with a life-limiting illness can be exhausting.

Each client will differ in the level of information they share about their reflections but it should be acknowledged that this first conversation about their preferences is an important milestone.</p><p>If a person is open to discussing their reflections, it would be great to start with the Discussion Starter</p><p>Booklet 3 – About your health care.

In this case, a soft introduction to the discussion may include a review of their previous reflections and how relevant they are at this point. This exercise will support the person to consider how and if their preferences have changed before building on these further with Discussion Starter Booklet 3: About your health care and Discussion Starter Booklet 4: About care at the end of life. When discussing Booklet 4, be conscious that people may be comfortable openly discussing the first questions but may need some additional time to reflect on the later questions.</p><p><b>Working with patients who have discussed</b></p><p>When working with people who have discussed their end-of-life preferences previously, it may be good to start with a general reflection exercise with questions such as:</p><ul><li>When did you last discuss your end-of-life preferences?</li><li>Who did you discuss this with?</li><li>What initiated the discussion?</li></ul><p>This exercise will allow the client to lead the conversation and give the staff an indication of their comfort level on the topic.

What is personal information?</b></p><p>Definitions of ‘personal information’ differ around the world.  In Australia, the collection, storage, use and disclosure of ‘personal information’ is regulated by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the “Act”).  The Act defines ‘personal information’ as:</p><ul><li>information or an opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable</li></ul><p>The definition of ‘personal information’ is therefore extremely broad, but good examples would include your full name and your address.</p><p>Schedule 1 of the Act also sets out thirteen Australian Privacy Principles (the ‘APPs’) which comprehensively cover the protection of personal information.  You can feel confident that we will always collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with the Act, the APPs and this Privacy Policy.</p><p></p><p><b>3. Why do we need to collect your personal information?</b></p><p>We collect personal information reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities in connection with the Operational Purposes. This personal information may include sensitive information, and in some instances may include health information.

Where we do so, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws.</p><p></p><p><b>5. How do we use or hold your personal information?</b></p><p>We use and hold your personal information to facilitate the Operational Purposes, as well as our general operational, technical and administrative purposes.  We may from time to time share the personal information we collect with any of our relevant third parties, including our partners, suppliers, collaborators, advisers and business associates. We would only share your personal information with third parties where it is necessary in undertaking those activities that you have agreed to be involved.</p><p>Where you participate in research or a project, we may use your personal information (including sensitive information or health information) to create articles, reports, papers, presentations or other outputs.

How and when do we disclose your personal information?</b></p><p>Where necessary, we will disclose your personal information to our third party suppliers, partners, collaborators, contractors or others in order to facilitate the Operational Purposes.</p><p>Either PCA or our partners may disclose your personal information where it is reasonable to do so or where we are authorised or required to do so by applicable law. </p><p>PCA may disclose personal information to trusted third parties engaged to assist us with services including data processing, data analysis, information technology services and support, fundraising, event management, mobile application, website maintenance/development, printing, record archiving, data mailing and market research. </p><p>All research undertaken at PCA are approved by an external Human Research Ethics Committee.  All research is undertaken in accordance with the terms and conditions specified by the relevant Human Research Ethics Committee, and the principles specified in the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Research Council’s Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research 2007 (the Australian Code). Research participants enrolled in trials or research will be given further information detailing how their personal information (including health information) will be handled by PCA, including circumstances where personal information may be disclosed.</p><p></p><p><b>8. Security</b></p><p>We take reasonable steps to prevent the personal information we hold about you from misuse, interference or loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.  Our security measures meet industry standards and you can feel confident in our processes.  These may include access control procedures, network firewalls, encryption and physical security.

Quality of your personal information</b></p><p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold, use and disclose is accurate, up to date and complete.  However, we will not necessarily take any administrative steps to verify the accuracy or completeness of the information you provide to us (or a third party) at the time of collection (for example, if you make a mistake when typing in your details or choose to use a pseudonym).</p><p>If you suspect or believe that the personal information we have is not accurate, complete or up to date, please contact us at the details below and we will respond to your request within a reasonable period.  When responding, we will take reasonable steps to correct that information and to ensure that it remains accurate, complete and up to date in the future.  If for some reason we are unable to correct your personal information, we will provide you with our reasons and your further options for complaint.  We will not ordinarily charge you for requesting the correction of your personal information.</p><p></p><p><b>10. Access to your personal information</b></p><p>You are entitled to access the personal information we hold about you, on request, subject to a limited number of exceptions.  If for some reason we are unable to provide you with access to your personal information, we will provide you with our reasons as well as your further options for complaint.  If we did not collect your personal information directly from you, it may be more practical for us to pass your access request on to the relevant third party who did collect that information from you.</p><p>You may make an access request via the contact details below and we will respond to your request within a reasonable period.  We will not ordinarily charge you for gaining access to your personal information.</p><p></p><p><b>11. How long will we keep your personal information?</b></p><p>We retain personal information after we have used the personal information for the purposes for which we collected or received it.  The duration that we keep your personal information for will be influenced by the nature of that information, and any applicable regulatory requirements. For instance, the minimum recommended period for retention of research data is five years from the date of publication. However, in any particular case, the period for which research data should be retained is determined by the specific type of research. The Australian Code requires for most trials, retaining research data for 15 years or more may be necessary. Financial transaction records are kept for a minimum period of seven years.</p><p>For all types of personal information, when no longer required, PCA will use its best endeavours to ensure that all such information will be deleted or destroyed in a secure manner and in a reasonable timeframe.</p><p></p><p><b>12.
