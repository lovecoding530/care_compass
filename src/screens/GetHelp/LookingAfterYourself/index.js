              Many people who work in the health care sector do so with a desire
              to help others. For some clinicians this however can come at a
              cost to themselves and potentially, their personal relationships.
              It is important for clinicians to be aware of their own
              vulnerabilities, triggers, stress and compassion fatigue, and
              develop coping mechanisms to try and avoid burning out.
              Self-awareness is essential for the person themselves to monitor
              changes in their health and how this effects those around them
              such as their families, colleagues and patients. Therefore, people
              may undertake their own periodic self-reflection to gauge where
              they are at or to reflect on feedback from family or colleagues
              indicating they may need to consider their current resilience.

              There are times in most clinicians careers that self-reflection
              alone may not be enough. Often support can be as simple an
              informal discussion with a colleague but support can also be found
              in more formalised discussions such as case debriefs, mentoring
              and clinical supervision to aid self-reflection and increase
              resilience. Most organisations will have internal policies and
              procedures in place to support staff wellbeing and care. Some may
              also have formal arrangements in place for staff to access
              external services for counselling and debriefing, which may have
              particular relevance following a distressing or problematic
              experience. These can be accessed through most Human Resources or
              Staff Health Departments.
